## Problem: Have you ever tried renting a bike within our campus? It can be annoying right as sometimes you have to wait for the guard then you have to spend time signing up on a sheet just to finally get the key

### Pain Points: 
- We aren’t able to check the availability of the bicycles without actually physically being there 
- We can’t choose which type of bicycle (e.g. Basket Bike, Road Bike, etc.) we want.
- We could get the bad quality bicycles through random picking which could make our cycling experience unsatisfactory
- Waiting for the guard to actually come and give the signup sheet can take a long time.
- Filling in the information everytime when renting the bike is too troublesome and a waste of time

## This has to stop!

### Our solution
 Develop some sort of online system where staffs of university could rent bike conveniently and all they have to do is just simply show up and take their bike away

### Domain: 
Students, Professors, University staffs and Guards who will be managing the bikes rental system which they usually do

### Stakeholders:
- Students
- Professors
- Guards
- University employees

### Roles and responsibilities of each group:
- Students, Professors and Employees: Log in into the system, book and check availability of bicycles on the system online without actually being there.
- Guards: Can check when someone has a booking so they can be ready at the bicycle retrieval place with the keys ready. Additionally they can confirm when someone shows up to pick up the bike or return the bike.
